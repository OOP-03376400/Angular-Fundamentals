# Angular Final Project
# Student System

## Project Description

Admins can create, edit and delete courses in Student System. Each course has a name, description, start and end dates, a list of trainers, a list of enrolled students and a list of user feedbacks. Admins can create, modify or delete course details, including course trainers. 

Anonymous users can view all available courses. User registration and login is required to view course details (course description, trainers, end dates and feedbacks). 

Users can register providing an email and password. Upon registration users are assigned a Student role. 

Authenticated users can enroll in any course, as well as cancel any existing course enrollment. Authenticated users can also write feedbacks on the courses they are enrolled in. Authenticated users can view their profiles: name & email address, list of user roles, list of trainer courses, list of courses studied.
